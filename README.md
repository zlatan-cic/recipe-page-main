### What I learned

I learned how to use CSS media queries to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes. By hiding and displaying images conditionally, I ensured an optimized user experience on both mobile and desktop devices. This approach improves the layout's flexibility and enhances the overall aesthetic of the page.
